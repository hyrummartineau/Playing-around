<h1>Natural Disasters</h1>
<h2>Flooding<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/12E18/production/_95963377_quebecfloods2.jpg"></h2>
<p>A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry.<br /> The European Union Floods Directive defines a flood as a covering by water of land not normally covered by water. In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide.<br />

Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood.<br /> While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals.<br />

Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway.<br /> Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers.<br /> While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water, people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry.<br />

Some floods develop slowly, while others such as flash floods, can develop in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain.<br /> Additionally, floods can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins.</p>
<h3>Fires<img src="https://www.wyohistory.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/yellowstonefires5.jpg?itok=DdSRPM8i"></h3>
<p>Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.<br /> Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition.<br />

Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular oxygen, O2, to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water releases energy (418 kJ per 32 g of O2); the bond energies of the fuel play only a minor role here.<br /> At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced. The flame is the visible portion of the fire. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma.<br /> Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.

Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning.<br /> Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe.<br /> The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.<br />

The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination.<br /> If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water.<br /> Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil.<br /> This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which only slowly recovers as nitrogen is "fixed" from the atmosphere by lightning and by leguminous plants such as clover.<br />

Fire has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.</p>
<h4>Hurricanes<img src="http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170524204917-hurricane-igor-large-169.jpg"></h4>
<p><strong>Hurricane Basics</strong><br />

<strong>What</strong>
Hurricanes are massive storm systems that form over the water and move toward land.<br /> Threats from hurricanes include high winds, heavy rainfall, storm surge, coastal and inland flooding, rip currents, and tornadoes.<br /> These large storms are called typhoons in the North Pacific Ocean and cyclones in other parts of the world.<br />

<strong>Where</strong>
Each year, many parts of the United States experience heavy rains, strong winds, floods, and coastal storm surges from tropical storms and hurricanes.<br /> Affected areas include all Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastal areas and areas over 100 miles inland, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Hawaii, parts of the Southwest, the Pacific Coast, and the U.S. territories in the Pacific. A significant per cent of fatalities occur outside of landfall counties with causes due to inland flooding.<br/>

<strong>When</strong>
The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with the peak occurring between mid-August and late October. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season begins May 15 and ends November 30.
